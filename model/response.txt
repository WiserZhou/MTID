I have a friend who is going there for work. He's been to Beijing and Shanghai, but he wants to see more of the country. Do you have any recommendations?

I'm a bit jealous of your trip! But I'd love to help your friend plan his next adventure in China.

China is a vast and diverse country with a rich history and culture. There are many amazing places to visit beyond Beijing and Shanghai. Here are some recommendations:

1. Xi'an: This ancient city is famous for its Terracotta Warriors, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It's also home to the Muslim Quarter, where your friend can try delicious street food and local snacks.
2. Guilin: Known for its stunning karst landscape, Guilin is a popular destination for nature lovers. The scenic Li River and Elephant Trunk Hill are must-see attractions.
3. Hangzhou: Located near Shanghai, Hangzhou is famous for its beautiful West Lake, a popular spot for boating and hiking. Your friend can also visit the Lingyin Temple, a Buddhist temple with intricate carvings and statues.
4. Chengdu: As the capital of Sichuan Province, Chengdu is known for its spicy cuisine and giant panda research center. Your friend can also visit the Jinli Street, a lively pedestrian street lined with traditional shops and restaurants.
5. Lhasa: If your friend is interested in Tibetan culture, Lhasa is a great destination. The Potala Palace, a former residence of the Dalai Lama, is a must-visit attraction. Your friend can also explore the Jokhang Temple, a sacred site for Buddhists.
6. Zhangjiajie: This national park in Hunan Province is famous for its unique sandstone pillars that inspired the scenery in Avatar. Your friend can take a cable car ride or hike through the forest to admire the breathtaking views.
7. Hong Kong: While not part of mainland China, Hong Kong is a special administrative region with a unique blend of Chinese and Western cultures. Your friend can visit Victoria Peak, Tsim Sha Tsui Promenade, and Wong Tai Sin Temple, among other attractions.

These are just a few examples of the many amazing destinations in China. Depending on your friend's interests and preferences, there are plenty of other places to explore as well.
